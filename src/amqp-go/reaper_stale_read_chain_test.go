// Loop 3 Step 2 — does the stale-read chain CLOSE?
//
// Three fragments were separately EXECUTED by earlier steps and never joined in
// one execution:
//
//	(1) PRODUCER (gap member 4, R1). A durable=false queue leaves a permanent
//	    metadata record holding ordinal N; after restart+redeclare the broker
//	    re-mints tags into a band still carried by physically-present records of
//	    the previous incarnation.
//	(2) READ (D2b + the reachability run). WALManager.Acknowledge deletes the
//	    tag's offsetIndex entry, after which readMessage falls back to
//	    readMessageSequential, which searches oldFiles UNCONDITIONALLY BEFORE the
//	    current file and returns a stale record as a live message.
//	(3) CONSUMER (DERIVED only). broker/queue_reaper.go reapTTLSweep probes every
//	    tag in its window with b.storage.GetMessage and its own comment documents
//	    the expectation that an acked tag comes back empty. If a stale record
//	    answers instead it can be dead-lettered as expired, and the tail-advance
//	    loop breaks on a non-nil message so the tail stops advancing.
//
// THE COUNTER-ARGUMENT the previous step could not settle: the reaper only
// sweeps a CONSUMER-LESS queue, and the WAL read is only reached for a tag that
// is OUT OF THE RING. Nobody had shown those two conditions co-occur.
//
// These two tests are written to make BOTH answers reachable, and to keep them
// attributable to different mechanisms:
//
//	S1 — ONE incarnation. No member 4, no prior-incarnation record, no oldFiles.
//	     It asks only whether the reaper's own removal of a message from the ring
//	     puts that tag back on the WAL read path. S1 is the ATTRIBUTION CONTROL
//	     for S2: if S1 already amplifies, then an amplified S2 says nothing about
//	     member 4 on its own and only the boot-1 MessageIDs do.
//
//	S2 — TWO incarnations, the mandated chain end to end: non-durable queue with
//	     x-message-ttl + a DLX, boot 1 publishes DeliveryMode==2 and acks, restart,
//	     redeclare, republish, left CONSUMER-LESS so the reaper sweeps. A
//	     dead-lettered message carrying a BOOT-1 MessageID is a prior
//	     incarnation's record resurrected through the production read path, which
//	     is the whole chain in one execution.
//
// Both tests measure through the shipped AMQP surface only: publish with
// confirms, consume the dead-letter queue. Nothing reaches into storage.
