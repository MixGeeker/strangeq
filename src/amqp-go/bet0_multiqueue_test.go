// ============================================================================
// Bet 0 — multi-queue delivery liveness and the invariants the per-queue dense
// sequencing fix must not break.
//
// THE BUG (P0, reproduced by TestBet0_ConcurrentMultiQueueDelivery): internal
// delivery tags are minted from ONE broker-global counter, but every queue's
// dispatch plane assumes its own tag space is DENSE — Claim walks tail one
// integer at a time up to head. With two or more queues publishing concurrently
// the tags interleave, so for each queue every tag minted by another queue is a
// permanent hole below its head. Each hole is only recognised as a hole AFTER a
// full cold-read miss (ring miss -> read-ahead miss -> WAL ReadBatch -> WAL Read
// -> queue-name mismatch -> segment miss). Hole-crawl throughput can never
// outrun tag-mint throughput, so consumers fall permanently behind and delivery
// collapses to ~0 msg/s on EVERY queue. Single queue is unaffected, which is why
// every published benchmark (all single-queue) missed it.
//
// Measured on main (commit 8a65f98) with the standalone perftest harness,
// 2 queues x 3 producers/3 consumers, durable+confirm, 1 KB bodies, 12s:
// 1,668,046 published, 558 consumed (99.97% never delivered).
//
// WHY THE EXISTING MULTI-QUEUE TESTS MISS IT: they publish sequentially or at
// low volume, so a queue's hole count stays small enough to crawl. The failure
// is a RATE failure — holes accrue faster than they can be crawled — so it only
// appears under SUSTAINED CONCURRENT publishing to two or more queues, and it is
// only visible if consumption is measured DURING the publish window rather than
// after an unbounded drain.
//
// The P0 sampling phase and fixture-shutdown guards are deliberately bounded.
// The exact drain has no total deadline: it can run indefinitely while expected
// identities continue to make progress, and fails only after inactivity.

// and is unchanged by this one. Conflating the two is exactly the failure
// mode this constant exists to prevent — see below.
//
// It was 400 (4.0s), and that is too tight to be a timeout — it was silently
// acting as a threshold. Under `go test -race` broker startup exceeds 4s, so
// TestBet0_DeleteRacingTxCommitCannotOrphanCommittedMessages and Case B both
// died at ~4.3s with "server listener not ready" and therefore NEVER RAN under
// the race detector at all: two correctness tests reported as covered by a
// slice that had not executed them.
//
// This is a startup timeout, not an assertion. Raising it weakens nothing —
// every behavioural deadline in these tests is separate and unchanged — it only
// stops the harness from failing a test before its subject has started.
// A too-tight budget does not make a test fail late — it makes the test fail
// BEFORE its subject has started, and the test then reports as covered while
// never having run.
//
// 2000 (20s) WAS ALSO OBSERVED INSUFFICIENT, so this is the same landmine going
// off a second time, one order of magnitude further out. Under a load average
// of ~4.8 — routine for a shared CI runner — five tests failed simultaneously
// with "server listener not ready", taking 21.8-25.0s each; the same five on a
// quiet machine start in 0.37-3.40s. A 10-60x swing in startup, and the harness
// failing tests whose subject never began, reported as if multi-queue recovery
// were broken.
//
// 6000 (60s) is ~18x the quiet-machine worst case. A genuine hang still fails,
// just later — which is the correct trade for a timeout that has now twice been
// mistaken for an assertion.
//
// Until this sweep, three more helpers (f1AggServer in f1_aggressive_test.go,
// f1Server in f1_starvation_test.go, and confBroker.startEmbedded in
// conformance_harness_test.go) each carried their OWN, independent copy of
// this budget — hardcoded at 200 polls x 10ms, or 100 polls x 20ms — both of
// which are the same 2s that had already been proven insufficient above. They
// survived at 2s only because nothing tied them to this constant: someone
// raised the copy in front of them and the other three did not move. That is
// how four separate near-misses of the same landmine coexisted in one
// package. All four sites now share brokerStartupPolls and
// brokerStartupPollInterval so tightening one tightens (and can be reasoned

// Spec basis: AMQP 0-9-1 §1.1 — a queue delivers to its consumers; §2.1.1 the
// broker is a shared service across queues. A queue's delivery liveness MUST NOT
// depend on whether OTHER, unrelated queues are being published to. Two queues
// each under an identical load that one queue alone sustains at ~137K msg/s must
// both keep delivering.
//
// Shape (proven repro, dossier §6): 2 queues x 3 producers / 3 consumers each,
// sustained concurrent publishing. The assertion is on consumption measured
// DURING the publish window, and it goes through bet0CheckLiveness — see
// bet0_liveness_predicate_test.go for the predicate and for the measurements
// behind every threshold it applies.
//
// Uninstrumented, that predicate still enforces the original floor: each queue
// must consume at least bet0MinDeliveredFraction (0.50) of what it published.
// Healthy single-queue behaviour is ~0.97 and broken main is ~0.0006, so that
// floor has three orders of magnitude of margin and is not a tuning knob.
// UNDER -race THAT FLOOR IS UNDECIDABLE — the healthy and broken rate bands
// overlap — so it is disabled there and the diagnostic becomes cross-queue
// balance plus a liveness backstop. It is disabled, NOT lowered; lowering it is
// the banned fix. The predicate file explains why at length. Read it before
// changing anything here.
//
// The second assertion — every identity whose Publish call returned nil is
// eventually observed after a successful Ack — is the correctness half. Exact
// target inclusion proves safety; reset-on-exact-target-progress inactivity
// bounds a genuinely stalled mechanism without imposing a total drain deadline.
//
// Three shapes, because the transient failure mode is CONDITIONAL. Gap-crawling
// a foreign tag costs a full cold-read miss only when the WAL actually has
// content to read: on an all-transient broker with an empty WAL the miss returns
// almost immediately, so hole-crawl can outrun tag-mint and the queues stay
// healthy — until the ring fills past the spill threshold and transient
// publishes start writing to the WAL, at which point it collapses. The MIXED
// shape (one durable queue populating the WAL, one transient queue beside it) is
// the realistic transient failure and is deployed everywhere; all-transient is
// carried as a guard that must stay healthy.

//
// Today a queue's dispatch cursor is recovered as the RANGE [minTag, maxTag] of
// its surviving global tags, and holes inside that range (tags acked before the
// restart) are discovered lazily at delivery time. Once sequencing is per-queue
// and dense, the surviving messages of each queue must be RENUMBERED into a
// dense sequence at recovery — and the delivery tag is not persisted in the WAL
// record (it is derived on read-back), so that renumbering is genuinely
// reconstructed rather than read back. Renumbering is easy to get right when the
// survivors are a contiguous suffix and easy to get WRONG when they are
// scattered, so this test acks every EVEN sequence and leaves every ODD one
// outstanding, producing a maximally sparse survivor set on two interleaved
// queues at once.
//
// Invariants asserted after restart, per queue:
//   - every unacked (odd) message is redelivered — none lost;
//   - nothing is delivered twice within the post-restart pass;
//   - everything recovered arrives in ascending publication order.
//
// Deliberately NOT asserted: that an already-acked message never comes back.
// AMQP 0-9-1 is an at-least-once protocol, and Server.Stop() closes the listener
// without checkpointing the ack state, so a restart is crash-equivalent and
// redelivering an acked message is permitted. (Measured on main: acked messages
// DO resurface here. That is a real durability observation, but it is
// pre-existing, spec-legal, and out of scope for Bet 0 — it must not be smuggled
// into this test as a fix requirement.) Acked messages that resurface are

// CONSUME. None of them PUBLISHES after the restart, so none of them can see a
// per-queue sequence counter that failed to be restored.
//
// The invariant: after a restart, a queue must never mint a delivery tag it has
// already used. The delivery tag is the shared WAL's key — `offsetIndex` is
// written as `qw.offsetIndex[rec.Offset]` (storage/wal_manager.go:771, :1338,
// :1346) and read at :2199, and the WAL stamps `DeliveryTag: off` on read-back
// (:1819) — so a reissued tag overwrites a live index entry. It also lands below
// the queue's recovered claim cursor, where no consumer will ever reach it.
// Either way the message is silently lost, and no liveness test would notice.
//
// The sharpest case is a queue that was FULLY consumed and acked before the
// restart: nothing is recovered as unacked, so a sequence counter restored only
// from recovered messages has nothing to restore from and rewinds to zero, while
// the WAL records of those acked messages are still physically present. This
// test builds exactly that state on two interleaved durable queues, restarts,
// then publishes a fresh batch and requires every one of the new messages to be
// delivered, in order, with confirms honoured.
//
// SCOPE — what this test does and does not assert. It asserts only that every
// POST-restart confirmed message is delivered exactly once and in order. It does
// NOT assert that already-acked PRE-restart messages stay gone, even though they
// demonstrably resurface: Server.Stop() does not checkpoint ack state, so a
// restart is crash-equivalent, and AMQP 0-9-1 is at-least-once, which makes that
// redelivery spec-legal. TestBet0_SparseMultiQueueRecovery in this file already
// records that ruling, and an earlier draft of this test contradicted it by
// failing on any pre-restart delivery. That assertion was wrong against the spec
// and has been removed; resurrected messages are now counted and reported.
//
// The resurrection itself is a real and separate durability defect (acked
// records in the not-yet-rolled WAL file are never reclaimed, so they recover
// forever). It is PRE-EXISTING — this test's post-restart-loss assertion fails
// identically on unmodified main — and belongs to its own workstream, not to the
// per-queue sequencing change. Keeping the two apart is what lets this test be a
// gate for sequence reuse without being a hostage to the other bug.

// comes back after a restart believing it owns a different tag space from the

// Property (a) — each queue's own ordinal is durably persisted — is exercised by
// TestBet0_DeleteRedeclareDoesNotReuseIdentity and by the restart tests.
//
// Property (b), covered here, is the ordinal ALLOCATOR's high-water mark. When a
// queue is deleted its metadata record goes away, but its durable records stay
// in the shared WAL (there is no purge-by-queue). If the allocator rebuilds its
// high-water only from the metadata of queues that still EXIST, then after a
// restart it can hand out an ordinal that a deleted queue already used — and the
// new owner of that ordinal starts minting tags that collide, in a broker-wide
// bare-uint64-keyed index, with records that are still physically present. That
// is cross-incarnation bleed reached through the allocator rather than through a
// single queue name, and no per-queue check would catch it.
//
// Two sequences, both requiring a restart to sit BETWEEN the delete and the next
// declare — which is exactly what none of the other tests do:
//
//  1. same name:  declare A -> publish -> delete A -> RESTART -> declare A ->
//     publish -> RESTART -> consume. A's second incarnation must serve only its
//     own messages.
//  2. fresh name: after A is deleted and the broker restarted, a brand-new queue
//     B must not be handed A's retired ordinal. B publishes, restarts, and must
//     get every one of its messages back.
//
// Sequence 2 is the one that isolates the allocator: B has no history of its
// own, so anything it loses can only have come from inheriting a dirty ordinal.

//
// TestBet0_ConcurrentMultiQueueDelivery — the original P0 repro — publishes
// WITHOUT publisher confirms. It passes on the fixed broker. But the real
// benchmark workload (and the one the whole bet exists to unlock) is durable
// publishes WITH confirms and a bounded outstanding window, and under THAT shape
// one queue still receives essentially nothing while its neighbour runs at full
// speed. Measured with the standalone perftest harness, 2 queues x 3 producers /
// 3 consumers, durable+confirm, 1 KB bodies, 12s: the starved queue consumed
// 304 / 430 / 302 across three runs while its neighbour consumed ~1.72M each
// time — and with confirms turned OFF and nothing else changed, both queues ran
// healthily at ~199K/s aggregate.
//
// The confirm path matters mechanically, not incidentally: a bounded outstanding
// window couples the producer to the broker's confirm latency, so a queue whose
// confirms or deliveries stall throttles its own publishers. Testing only the
// unbounded no-confirm path cannot observe that coupling at all.
//
// It asserts the same liveness property as the original repro — each queue must
// consume a substantial fraction of what it published, measured DURING the
// publish window — because the defect is a rate failure, invisible to any
// after-the-fact drain.
//
// HONEST LIMITATION — THIS TEST DOES NOT REPRODUCE THE *PERFTEST* STARVATION,
// the concurrent-declare one described above. Uninstrumented it passes at
// 0.997/0.998 for 2 queues and ~0.985 for 4 at outstanding=1000. Do not read
// its green as coverage of that defect.
//
// ⚠️ CORRECTION, measured 2026-07-26: that sentence used to read "THIS TEST DOES
// NOT REPRODUCE THAT BUG" without qualification, and on the blanket reading it
// is FALSE. Under -race this shape DOES reproduce the multi-queue P0 on the
// pre-fix tree: ported to 8a65f98 it starves q2 to consumed=0, 3 runs of 3
// (q1 ratios 0.2141 / 0.2729 / 0.3011 beside q2 at 0.0000). So this test carries
// a real pristine-red obligation and its thresholds get the same treatment and
// the same proof as the P0 repro's — not a weaker one. The original claim was
// about the perftest case specifically; it read as blanket, and was believed as
// blanket, which is why it is spelled out here.
//
// The reason it cannot reproduce it is itself the key diagnostic. The trigger is
// CONCURRENT QUEUE DECLARATION, not load and not confirms alone. Two perftest
// processes declare their queues at the same instant and one queue then starves
// for the life of the process (4/4 runs, including at 1 producer / 1 consumer
// where the healthy queue runs at 101K/s, far below the 145K single-queue
// ceiling — so there is spare capacity the starved queue cannot use). Staggering
// the two declares by three seconds recovers it 3/3. Turning confirms off with
// simultaneous declares is also healthy. It needs BOTH concurrent declare AND
// confirms.
//
// This test declares every queue sequentially from one client before publishing,
// which is exactly the staggered-declare case. A test that reproduces the real
// defect must race the DECLARES across independent connections, and should be
// written once the mechanism is understood — guessing at the race shape would

// The window: DeclareQueue reads the queue's metadata record LOCK-FREE

// that pointer straight to declareExistingQueue WITHOUT ever taking the
// per-name create mutex. declareExistingQueue re-installs the queue in
// activeQueues and calls getOrCreateQueueState. If a DeleteQueue completes in
// between, the declarer is holding a record that no longer exists on disk: it
// republishes the queue into the routing cache and creates a fresh QueueState
// whose ordinal resolveQueueOrdinal allocates but — with no record to write it
// into — never persists. The result is a live, publishable, record-less queue.
//
// Pinning is done by blocking INSIDE storage.GetQueue, after the real read has
// returned, so the declarer holds exactly the stale value it would hold in the
// real interleaving. The trap fires only for a call whose stack is inside
// DeclareQueue, so unrelated GetQueue callers (DeleteQueue's own pre-check runs
// on another goroutine while this one is parked) pass through untouched — the

// queue.delete was tearing down.
//
// Spec basis: AMQP 0-9-1 §1.8.3.9 / the publisher-confirms contract — a
// basic.ack for a persistent publish is the broker's promise that the message
// is safely stored and will survive a restart. A queue.delete racing a declare
// is an ordinary concurrent-client situation; it may legally destroy the queue
// (and everything in it), and it may legally make subsequent publishes
// unroutable. What it may NOT do is take the promise and then break it.
//
// The obligation set is therefore acked-MINUS-returned: publishes go out
// mandatory, so a message the broker declined to route comes back as a
// basic.return before its ack (spec ordering) and is correctly excluded — the
// broker never promised to store it. Everything remaining was promised, and
// every one of those must be consumable after the restart. If the broker
// refuses the whole batch the obligation set is empty and the property holds
// vacuously; that is a legitimate way to pass, and the counts are logged so a
// vacuous pass is never mistaken for a meaningful one.
//
// Why this cannot pass by accident: the assertion is on messages the broker
// positively acknowledged, read back through a real restart and a real
// consumer. No internal state is inspected, so the test stays valid under any
// fix — a lock, a tombstone, a refusal to resurrect, or a redesign.

// for a message that recovery will discard is the worst version of this bug.
//
// The window is pinned at COMMIT time, not publish time: the tx manager buffers

// would pin nothing.
//
// Obligation, same shape as the sibling tests: if commit succeeds the broker
// promised to store the message and it MUST survive the restart. If commit
// fails, the broker refused and owes nothing — but the refusal must be ACTIVE
// (a non-nil commit error), so a run that never exercised the race cannot slip
// through the empty-obligation branch reporting success.

//     is about to hand this queue's consumers tags that belong to another

// different in a way that matters: republishToTargets calls
// getOrCreateQueueState(target) DIRECTLY, on a target list resolved earlier.
// It never consults activeQueues, so unlike route (b) it does not need the
// routing cache to still hold the queue — a target deleted in the meantime is
// reached anyway. Today all three routes are covered by the same
// record-existence guard in createQueueStateLocked, which is exactly why route
// (c) needs its own test: a future change that kept the guard working for the
// routing paths while breaking it here would leave routes (a) and (b) green.
//
// THE WINDOW, and why the pin is load-bearing rather than decorative.
// queue.delete removes the queue's BINDINGS as well as the queue. So if this
// test simply deleted the target and then dead-lettered, routing would resolve
// ZERO targets, republishToTargets would never run, and the test would pass
// while exercising nothing at all. The defect needs the republish to hold a
// target list resolved BEFORE the delete and act on it AFTER — so the pin
// blocks inside storage.GetExchangeBindings, after the real read has returned,
// for the one call whose stack is inside deadLetter. The delete then completes
// while the republisher is parked holding precisely the stale list the real
// interleaving gives it. Pinned by identity, no sleeps, no timing assumptions.
//
// WHAT IS ASSERTED, at two different strengths, deliberately — and IN THIS
// ORDER, for the reason given at the second one:
//
//  2. The republish is DROPPED, observably. This is route (c)'s own bail (the
//     StopCh select in republishToTargets) and the broker's warn is the only
//     observable that distinguishes it: the optional metrics counter
//     (RecordDeadLetterDropped) is SHARED with the store-failure and
//     x-overflow=reject-publish drops, so a counter assertion could not tell
//     this cause from the other two and would go green on a fixture where this
//     path never ran. Both other causes are also structurally impossible here
//     — the target carries no x-max-length/x-overflow policy at all, and no
//     store failure is injected — but the test asserts on the discriminating
//     message anyway rather than resting on that argument.
//
//  1. The end-to-end C1 property: nothing the broker CONFIRMS may be lost. A
//     re-declared queue must be a clean, correctly-identified queue. This is
//     what catches the severe form of the defect — without the record-existence
//     guard the republish installs a LIVE, record-less QueueState for the
//     deleted name, holding an ordinal that was allocated but never persisted;
//     a later declare of that name then finds and reuses that state, so the
//     queue's metadata says one ordinal while its dispatch plane mints tags in
//     another, and every durable message confirmed against it is discarded at
//     the next restart as a dead incarnation's.

// 19. DeclareQueue must not read a transient storage failure as "deleted".
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

// TestBet0_DeclareQueueTransientReadFailureDoesNotRebandLiveQueue pins a
// two-layer contract that only a test can hold against drift.
//
// DeclareQueue's re-read under the create mutex has three outcomes, and the
// third is the dangerous one: the record is there (redeclare it), the record is
// genuinely gone (a concurrent delete won — fall through and mint a NEW
// incarnation with a fresh, PERSISTED ordinal band), or the read FAILED. Only
// the second may fall through. Treating a failed read as "gone" would allocate
// and persist a new ordinal band for a queue that is still alive, re-banding
// its future delivery tags and stranding every record already written under the
// old band — recovery would then read those as a dead incarnation's and discard
// them, losing confirmed messages.
//
// The distinction rests on a contract spanning TWO layers: the storage layer
// must report genuine absence as a bare interfaces.ErrQueueNotFound and every
// other failure as something else, and DeclareQueue must gate its fallthrough
// on exactly that. Reading the code proves today's values; a future storage
// change that wrapped ErrQueueNotFound anywhere would silently invert the
// branch, and nothing but a test would notice. That is what this pins.
//
// The failure is injected at the seam the other C1 tests already use
// (ServerBuilder.WithStorage), targeted precisely enough to hit the re-read
// under the mutex while leaving the lock-free pre-check untouched — see
// armFault. No production code is involved in the injection.
//
// Assertion order is deliberate and follows the lesson from the route-(c)
// test: the end-to-end property is checked FIRST, so that a regression cannot
// be absorbed by the weaker API-level assertion before the property is ever
// evaluated.
