// R1 — gap member 4: durable records in a NON-DURABLE queue.
//
// Loop 3 Step 0 recorded this as DERIVED, not executed, and as the cheapest
// door in the Door-1 gap:
//
//	DeclareQueue persists a metadata record for EVERY queue (the durability
//	check only gates updateDurableMetadata), so a durable=false queue leaves a
//	permanent record carrying an allocated Ordinal N. DeliveryMode==2 publishes
//	to it take the DURABLE WAL branch with no spill threshold involved, and
//	their acks enter the ack set. At restart, recoverPersistentMessages resolves
//	hasRecord=true / durable=false, raises a BenignFault, REAPS, and never calls
//	RecoverSeq — so no span is widened and nextSeq stays at its zero value. The
//	redeclare reclaims ordinal N from its own surviving metadata record and
//	re-mints (N<<44)|0,1,2,... straight into the tag band the previous
//	incarnation already used.
//
// WHAT IS AND IS NOT CLAIMED HERE, because it decides how this test is written.
//
// On the CURRENT tree acknowledgement is not durable at all, so no inherited
// ack set exists and nothing is destroyed today. Member 4 is a hazard OF THE
// PROPOSED FIX, not a live data-loss defect. What IS true of the current tree,
// and what this test establishes as an executed fact, is member 4's
// PRECONDITION — the thing that makes any tag-keyed durable ack set unsafe:
//
//	after a restart and redeclare of a non-durable queue, the broker re-mints
//	delivery tags that are ALREADY CARRIED by physically-present records of the
//	previous incarnation, which were delivered and acknowledged before the
//	restart.
//
// Two physically distinct records, different MessageIDs, same delivery tag,
// both on disk at once. That is the whole of the hazard: any ack set keyed by
// tag value cannot tell them apart, so an ack recorded against the first
// silently cancels the second.
//
// The destruction is then demonstrated against a SIMULATED tag-keyed ack set
// (the exact artifact the three withdrawn cycles built) rather than by shipping
// the buggy code — see the destroyed/surviving partition at the end.
//
// Five boots: broker boot 1, a storage-level reader, broker boot 2, a second
// reader, broker boot 3. The three-boot minimum in
// .notes/loop-2/deferred-ack-durability.md §4.6 exists because cycle 2's
// end-to-end test read back within ONE incarnation and was structurally blind
// to the stale-snapshot door.
