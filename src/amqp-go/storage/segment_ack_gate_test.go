// F2 — the SEGMENT TIER's acknowledgement gate. THIS IS A REGRESSION GATE, not
// a demonstration of an open defect.
//
// HISTORY, because it changes what a red here means. This fixture was written
// when the segment tier was ungated: QueueSegments.readMessage consults no ack
// bitmap, and acknowledgeInSegment only increments deletedCount — it never
// removes the offset from currentIndex.entries or segment.index. A record
// checkpointed out of the WAL and into a segment therefore had NO gated read
// path at all, and this fixture was RED, establishing that defect.
//
// It is now GREEN, and what closed it is the acknowledgement gate in
// DisruptorStorage.GetMessage — WALManager.IsAcknowledged, consulted once below
// the ring read and re-validated after the tier read. QueueSegments itself is
// still ungated and that is deliberate: the gate sits ABOVE all four tiers
// rather than inside any of them. GetMessage consults them in this order:
//
//	ring.LoadByTag     -> removed by the ack itself, before either durable ack
//	                      (DeleteMessage / DeleteMessageIfPresent), so a ring
//	                      hit means no acknowledgement was issued here
//	== the acknowledgement gate: every tier below this line is covered ==
//	readAhead.get      -> gated here; also invalidated by readAheadBuffer.remove
//	wal.ReadBatch      -> gated here; needs an offsetIndex entry
//	wal.Read           -> gated here; also has its own QueueWAL-level gate
//	segments.Read      -> GATED HERE. It is gated nowhere else, which is why
//	                      this fixture exists and why it is the arm that proves
//	                      the gate covers the tier no per-tier fix reached.
//	== the re-validate: catches an ack landing during the tier read ==
//
// WHAT A RED HERE MEANS NOW. The only mutation that reddens this fixture is
// removing the GetMessage acknowledgement gate — verified: deleting either
// guard alone leaves it green (each is separately attributed by
// getmessage_ack_gate_test.go), and deleting BOTH reddens it here. So a failure
// is a regression in that gate, not evidence of a surviving hole.
//
// Attribution to the SEGMENT tier specifically is asserted rather than assumed:
// P4 below establishes that the WAL can no longer answer, so the segment arm is
// the only remaining explanation for a served record. walReadErr is captured
// and reported for that reason.
//
// PREMISES, ALL ASSERTED AT RUNTIME rather than assumed, because a green on a
// broken premise is vacuous and a red on one is attributed to the wrong thing:
//
//	P1. the WAL actually ROLLED             (performCheckpoint only ever
//	                                         operates on rolled files)
//	P2. the victim tag is in a ROLLED file  (so the checkpoint can move it)
//	P3. the record actually REACHED a segment and is readable there BEFORE any
//	    ack (so a later read cannot be answered from anywhere else)
//	P4. the WAL can no longer answer for it (so the segment arm is the only
//	    remaining explanation for a served record)
//
// The unacked control is the discriminator: without it, a fix that broke reads
// outright would satisfy the acked assertion and pass.
