// Queue name <-> segment directory.
//
// Queue names are CLIENT-CONTROLLED (queue.declare carries an arbitrary
// shortstr) and filepath.Join CLEANS its result, so "../../x" resolved to a
// directory outside the data directory entirely: the broker created folders and
// wrote message bodies wherever the process could write, and — because
// RecoverFromSegments only walks the segments directory — the checkpointed copy
// was then unreachable, after performCheckpoint had already unlinked the source
// WAL file. Names that cannot be a single path element must therefore be
// escaped.
//
// WHY THE DIRECTORY NAME IS NOT THE ANSWER ON ITS OWN (review-4 B-1). The first
// attempt reserved "%" as an escape prefix and hex-DECODED any directory
// starting with it. That is unrecoverable ambiguity: the pre-fix build wrote
// filepath.Join(dataDir, queueName) for EVERY name that was a valid single path
// element, and that set includes every possible encoded form. A queue named
// "%2f" really did own <data>/segments/%2f, and the decode handed its
// checkpointed durable messages to a queue named "/" with err == nil. No escape
// prefix can be safe by inspection.
//
// THE MECHANISM. A directory this build creates carries a MARKER FILE holding
// the raw queue name; recovery reads it when present and otherwise treats the
// directory name as literal. Legacy directories have no marker, so they are
// literal BY CONSTRUCTION — genuinely zero migration — and the ambiguity
// disappears because the encoding announces itself instead of being inferred.
// Two consequences worth stating:
//
//   - "%" is no longer reserved. A "%"-prefixed name is an ordinary literal
//     name again, which also removes the 2x+1 expansion that pushed a 255-byte
//     "%"-prefixed name past NAME_MAX (review-4 B-2).
//   - Because the marker, not the string, carries identity, a generated
//     directory name needs only to be a creatable single path element. It is
//     length-bounded, and collisions with a LITERAL directory another queue
//     already owns are detected and probed past rather than silently shared.
//
// NOT INJECTIVE ON A CASE-INSENSITIVE OR NORMALISING FILESYSTEM. On macOS,
// queues "Queue" and "queue" are distinct AMQP entities that map to one
// directory, and NFC/NFD "café" collapses the same way (review-4 N-2). That is
// pre-existing, platform-specific, and reaches beyond storage into what a queue
// name IS; it is registered as an owned follow-up and is NOT closed here.

	// but UNUSABLE", and that the third state is never silently collapsed into
	// either of the other two — every caller already routes it to a classified
	// fault. Raw bytes cannot implement that contract: a marker truncated from
	// "payments-eu-west" to "payme" is a perfectly good queue name, and a
	// zero-length one is a perfectly good empty string. review-5 CRITICAL-1

	// under key "payme" with err == nil, and a zero-length one attributed a
	// queue's checkpointed messages to queue "" on a clean boot.
	//
	// WHAT "VALID" MEANS, decided deliberately and stated once:
	//
	//   - the header line is present and has exactly four tab-separated fields;

	//     truncated or trailing-byte-decorated file is rejected rather than
	//     guessed at (this is what makes "orders\n" != "orders" detectable);
	//   - the body's CRC32 matches the header's, so silent corruption of the
	//     name itself is rejected;
	//   - the name is 1..255 bytes. Empty is invalid because no queue can be
	//     named "" — server/queue_handlers.go substitutes a generated amq.gen.*
	//     name for an empty queue.declare — and 255 is the AMQP 0-9-1 shortstr
	//     maximum, so anything longer is damage, not a long name.
	//
	// The name itself is otherwise UNRESTRICTED: interior NULs, separators,
	// spaces and invalid UTF-8 are all legal queue names, and the marker's job
	// is to record the name faithfully, not to have opinions about it. Framing
	// validates the RECORD, never the name.
	//

//
// "As a real directory entry" is load-bearing and is the fix for review-5
// CRITICAL-2: os.Stat succeeds against a differently-spelled entry on a folding
// volume, so the name this function ASKED for is not evidence about the name
// that EXISTS. Because of that guarantee, getOrCreateQueueSegmentsAt's
// `dirName != queueName` test is a statement about the filesystem rather than
// about a string this function chose.
//
// KNOWINGLY OUT OF SCOPE: the create branch below folds too. MkdirAll(".../q")
// returns nil against an on-disk "Q" and creates nothing, so a TOCTOU between
// this call's os.Stat and a sibling's first touch can return a folded spelling.
// getOrCreateQueueSegmentsAt re-reads the marker and refuses if the sibling has
// already stamped one, leaving a window only while the sibling has created the
// directory but not yet marked it. Both queues are in one process, the
// checkpoint path is single-goroutine and recovery is sequential, and two
// processes sharing a data directory are already unsupported (there is no
// lockfile anywhere in this tree). Registered, not closed here.
//
// It creates rather than only resolving because a candidate can be rejected by
// the VOLUME rather than by its bytes: APFS enforces valid UTF-8 in filenames, so
// a queue named "\xab" has a perfectly legal literal candidate that mkdir
// refuses. Falling through to the generated candidate keeps such a name working
// — it worked before this change, when every non-literal name was encoded — and
// on a filesystem that accepts those bytes (ext4) the literal directory is used
// and any legacy one is adopted, so neither platform strands data.

// every tick: 50 / 100 / 150 futile attempts at t=1/2/3s, measured, forever,
// each one re-reading the segment and writing a temp file it then removed.
// Converting silent corruption into an unbounded retry that also blocks the ack
// path is not an improvement.
//
// The condition is now BOUNDED, OBSERVABLE and NON-BLOCKING:
//
//   - BOUNDED: the segment is withdrawn from compaction for the lifetime of the
//     process, so it is attempted exactly ONCE. This is safe because compaction
//     is space reclamation ONLY — never a durability or correctness requirement
//     — while the retry is a full read of the segment plus a temp-file write
//     under qs.compactionMux. The cost of refusing is bounded (one segment is
//     not reclaimed); the cost of retrying is unbounded.
//   - OBSERVABLE: RecordSegmentCompactionFailure() is the alertable counter, and
//     the log line names the file and the failing record.
//   - NOT HIDDEN FOREVER: the block is per-process, not persisted. A restart
//     re-evaluates, and a data fault of this shape is classified FATAL by
//     loadSegmentFile at that restart, which gates the boot unless the operator
//     passes --unsafe-recovery. So "stop trying" cannot bury the problem.
//
// The block is keyed on ANY compaction failure rather than only on data faults.
// An environment failure (a full filesystem at temp-write time) would clear on
// its own, so blocking is pessimistic there — but the alternative is to
// distinguish two classes of error by inspection and retry one of them forever,
// which is the behaviour this finding is about. One rule, no arbitrary retry

//
//   - Every failure UP TO AND INCLUDING os.Rename leaves the original file and
//     the original index EXACTLY as they were, removes the temp file, and
//     reports. Nothing observable changed.
//   - TWO paths return a non-nil error AFTER the rename has landed: a syncDir
//     failure (returned as syncErr at the very end, once the handle, index and
//     counters have all been swapped) and a failure to reopen the replaced file.
//     In both, the compacted file is already the segment on disk and the state
//     left behind is internally consistent, but "compactSegment returned an
//     error" must NOT be read as "nothing changed". tryCompaction only withdraws
//     the segment from future compaction on an error, which is correct either
//     way.
//
// Before Step 4 the copy loop was `if err == nil { ... if werr == nil { ... } }`
// with no else on either arm, and execution fell through to os.Rename
// regardless: a record that could not be read (bit rot, a torn write) or could
// not be written (a full filesystem) was silently omitted from the rewrite and
// then destroyed by the rename, with no error returned and no log line. The
// rename's own error was discarded too, which was worse than unreadable — the

// CLASSIFICATION. It is the WAL's (scanWALFile), applied to a tier that is
// authoritative for exactly the same reason — and deliberately NOT the
// derived-state policy this file used to apply:
//
//   - interior CRC failure, or a zero region followed by data  -> FATAL
//   - CRC failure on the last record / zero-filled tail / short
//     read at the tail                                         -> BENIGN
//   - the file cannot be opened or read                        -> DEGRADED
//
// AND IT NEVER TRUNCATES. The previous implementation used one `break` for
// every stop reason and then did file.Truncate(pos), so a single bad record in
// the middle physically destroyed every valid record after it, at boot, with
// no log, no metric and no count — on the only copy of the data. Nothing
// appends to a loaded segment (they are opened read-only and registered as
// sealed), so the truncation bought nothing.
//
// A FATAL or DEGRADED file is QUARANTINED: it is not registered, so no read
// can pair its bytes with an index, and the caller keeps scanning the rest of
// the directory.
