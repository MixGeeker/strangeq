// R2 — is a WAL fileNum REUSABLE across incarnations?
//
// Loop 3 Step 0 recorded "finding A-extra" as DERIVED, not executed:
//
//	rebuildBootState stores maxNum = the highest stem CURRENTLY EXISTING, so
//	openNextFile's Add(1) yields maxNum+1. If the highest-numbered file is
//	reclaimed while a lower-numbered one survives, fileNum regresses and the
//	next incarnation recreates that number. Therefore (fileNum, filePosition)
//	— already materialised as offsetLocation — is not unique across
//	incarnations.
//
// That claim prices candidate A (physical-locator attribution): if a locator
// can be re-minted, A needs a generation field and an ack naming a locator can
// silently cancel a DIFFERENT record than the one it was issued for.
//
// These tests exist to decide it by execution rather than by reading. They
// drive the exact state the finding names — a lower-numbered file surviving
// while higher-numbered files are reclaimed — and then ask the two questions
// the finding actually turns on:
//
//	Q1  can reclamation ever remove the highest-numbered file on disk?
//	Q2  does the next incarnation ever open a file number a previous
//	    incarnation already used?
//
// Q2 is the contract. It is stated as "no incarnation reopens a used number"
// rather than "fileNum is monotone" so that a fix which persisted a counter,
// or which tombstoned reclaimed stems, would satisfy it just as well as the
// current derive-from-disk scheme.
//
// Both tests reuse the incarnation harness in wal_incarnation_reuse_test.go
// (bootIncarnation / incarnationWALConfig / walFilesOnDisk / waitForAcksApplied),
// which already pins FileSize small enough that a few hundred records roll.
