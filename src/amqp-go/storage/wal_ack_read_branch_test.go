// Loop 3 Step 2, item 3 — WHICH READ ARM answers a probe of an ACKNOWLEDGED tag?
//
// The end-to-end fixture (reaper_stale_read_chain_test.go, S1) measured that a
// consumer-less TTL queue's reaper re-delivers a message it has already expired,
// dead-lettered, removed from the ring and acknowledged — without bound. That is
// the REACHABILITY evidence and it stands on its own.
//
// What it could not say is WHICH of DisruptorStorage.GetMessage's fall-through
// arms produced the message, and the fix depends entirely on that answer:
//
//	ring.LoadByTag        -> eliminated: the reaper's own deleteIfPresent removed it
//	readAhead.get         -> a cache, never invalidated on ack
//	wal.ReadBatch         -> requires an offsetIndex entry (it errors without one)
//	wal.Read -> readMessage
//	     fast path        -> requires an offsetIndex entry
//	     readMessageSequential
//	         oldFiles arm -> requires a ROLLED or INHERITED file
//	         current arm  -> gated ONLY by currentFileOffsets.Contains(offset)
//	segments.Read         -> requires a checkpoint, which only moves oldFiles
//
// This test drives the WALManager's PUBLIC API only — Write, ReadBatch,
// Acknowledge, Read — and eliminates the arms by EXECUTION rather than by
// reading the code:
//
//	P1. one physical WAL file exists  => oldFiles is empty       => oldFiles arm
//	    cannot match, and no checkpoint can have run => segments empty
//	P2. ReadBatch SUCCEEDS before the ack                        => the offsetIndex
//	    entry exists, so the fixture is exercising a real indexed record
//	P3. ReadBatch FAILS after the ack                            => the offsetIndex
//	    entry is GONE, so the readMessage fast path is eliminated AND no future
//	    ReadBatch can ever repopulate the read-ahead buffer
//
// With all of those executed, exactly ONE arm is left. If Read still returns the
// message, the current-file arm answered it, and the defective line is named:
// WALManager.Acknowledge removes the offset from offsetIndex (cleanupLoop) and
// NEVER from currentFileOffsets, which is only ever added to (flushBatch) and
// reset only by rollFile.
//
// NOTE ON WHAT THIS IS AND IS NOT. This is an INSTRUMENT for S1, not a
// replacement for it. It manufactures nothing: the ack goes through the shipped
// public entry point, and no index entry is hand-edited. But a WAL-layer test
// cannot establish reachability — S1 does that — so this file must never be
// cited as evidence that a deployment reaches this state.
