// WAL file-incarnation contract.
//
// QueueWAL.fileNum is an atomic.Uint64 whose only mutation site in the whole
// repository is `qw.fileNum.Add(1)` in openNextFile, and it starts at zero on
// every construction. So every boot opens 00000000000000000001.wal, with
// O_APPEND, on top of whatever a previous incarnation left there. Nothing at
// boot reconstructs oldFiles, currentFileOffsets, offsetIndex or ackBitmap.
//
// The consequence these tests pin: when the reopened file eventually rolls,
// rollFile registers it in oldFiles carrying ONLY this incarnation's offset
// bitmap, so tryDeleteOldFiles evaluates "every message in this file is acked"
// against a set that does not contain the previous incarnation's records — and
// os.Remove()s a file full of confirmed, unacknowledged durable messages.
//
// These are correctness tests. The cleanup path is driven directly instead of
// being waited for, so nothing here depends on which of two same-period tickers
// the runtime services first (canon rule 9: assert what happens, not how fast).
