// Boot-time reconstruction of the shared WAL's derived state.
//
// THE DEFECT THIS FILE EXISTS TO CLOSE. Every piece of state the shared WAL
// needs in order to READ a record back — fileNum, oldFiles, the per-file offset
// bitmaps, offsetIndex — is written exclusively by the WRITE path (openNextFile,
// rollFile, flushBatch) and was reconstructed by nothing at boot. Recovery
// extracted messages (RecoverFromWAL) but never rebuilt the index that makes
// them readable, and fileNum restarted at zero so every incarnation reopened
// 00000000000000000001.wal with O_APPEND. Two consequences, both reproduced:
//
//   - C-1: a recovered record that does not fit in the in-memory ring (above the
//     spill threshold) had NO readable durable location — offsetIndex was empty,
//     oldFiles was empty, currentFileOffsets was empty — so its delivery tag was
//     claimable and unreadable and the dispatch plane silently gap-skipped it.
//   - C-2: when the reopened file rolled, rollFile registered it in oldFiles with
//     ONLY this incarnation's offsets, so tryDeleteOldFiles judged it fully acked
//     and os.Remove()d a file full of confirmed, unacknowledged durable records.
//
// rebuildBootState fixes the cause rather than either symptom: it enumerates the
// shared WAL directory once, at construction, and restores fileNum, oldFiles
// (with the COMPLETE physical offset inventory of each pre-existing file) and
// offsetIndex, so that a pre-existing file is both readable and correctly
// judged by the reclamation predicate. Because fileNum resumes past the highest
// existing stem, a new incarnation never appends to a file it did not create,
// which is what makes "oldFiles carries this incarnation's offsets" true again.
//
// COST: startup only. It runs once inside createSharedWAL, before any background
// goroutine is started and before any write can be accepted. Nothing on the
// write, fsync, ack or delivery path calls into this file.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: it does not make acknowledgement
// durable. An earlier revision of this file persisted the WAL's ack bitmap to
// <sharedDir>/acks.snapshot and re-installed it at boot; that feature was
// WITHDRAWN. Acknowledgement in this broker is keyed by delivery tag, delivery
// tags are re-minted by design (broker/queue_dispatch.go FrontierReserve), and
// a persisted tag-keyed ack set therefore cannot distinguish "this ack cancels
// the record I just found" from "this ack cancels a record that is gone and a
// different, newer record happens to carry the same tag". Doing it safely needs
// per-record ack attribution (Artemis's Reclaimer criterion 2), which this
// architecture does not yet have. The full evidence — four criticals with
// measured loss numbers, the two doors the second cycle left open, and what a
// correct design would need — is in .notes/loop-2/deferred-ack-durability.md.
// Do not reintroduce a tag-keyed durable ack artifact without reading it.

// isWALFileName is THE predicate for "is this directory entry a shared-WAL
// segment", and it lives here, once (canon rule 12).
//
// It used to be two predicates that disagreed: rebuildBootState accepted only
// <digits>.wal via parseWALFileNum, while RecoverFromWAL accepted any *.wal —
// and the LOOSER one was the fatal one. So a .wal file with a non-numeric stem
// was invisible to the boot-state rebuild (no fileNum protection, no oldFiles
// entry, no offset inventory) yet was still scanned by recovery, where an
// unparseable header refused the boot. The refusal message advises moving the
// listed files aside; an operator who moved one aside as `damaged.wal` INSIDE
// the same directory re-armed the refusal through a path the rebuild could not
// even see. The message now says "out of the directory", and the two
// enumerations are one function.

// It is deliberately NOT scanWALFile: the boot index needs (offset, position)

// for full property decode + body copies of every record on disk at startup
// would make boot cost proportional to the whole WAL in allocations as well as
// I/O. The record grammar walked here is byte-for-byte the one scanWALFile
// walks (CRC + length framing, per-record type tag, v4 payload prefix), so the
// two cannot disagree about record boundaries.
//
// IT APPLIES THE SAME THREE-WAY CLASSIFICATION AS scanWALFile, and that is
// load-bearing rather than tidy. rebuildBootState runs at storage CONSTRUCTION
// and refuses there, before RecoverFromWAL ever runs — so if this walk silently
// skipped a bad-CRC record (which it did), a directory with one unparseable
// file AND one interior CRC failure produced a refusal naming only the first.
// The refusal message states that its artifact list is complete; that claim is
// only true if every fault class is enumerated in the same pass.
//
// A torn tail (short read, zero-filled tail, or a CRC failure with nothing
