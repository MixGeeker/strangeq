// R3 — candidate C's gate: can an ack in boot E2 name the epoch of a record
// written in boot E1, once that record has been checkpointed into a segment?
//
// Candidate C (Loop 3 Step 0, TASK C) proposes giving every record a durable
// uid (bootEpoch, tag), with the epoch stored ONCE IN THE WAL FILE HEADER
// rather than per record — which is what buys it zero per-publish cost. The
// consequence its own author named as the strongest argument against it:
//
//	the ack path knows the TAG, not the epoch, and must name the record's
//	ORIGINAL epoch. A record written in E1 and acked in E2 must be acked as
//	(E1, T). WAL-resident records resolve via
//	    offsetIndex -> offsetLocation.fileNum -> that file's header epoch
//	which is "machinery that already exists".
//
// and the failure mode if that resolution is wrong:
//
//	C names the ACKING epoch instead of the record's. Then (E2,T) never
//	matches the record's (E1,T), EVERY ACK SILENTLY BECOMES A NO-OP, the
//	feature is inert, and every test that only checks "nothing was destroyed"
//	stays GREEN.
//
// So the gate is: prove runnably that the resolution above still answers, in
// E2, for a record that E1 checkpointed into a segment. These tests execute
// that resolution rather than reasoning about it.
//
// Candidate C is NOT implemented and no production code is added here. What is
// under test is the RESOLUTION MECHANISM C would have to use, which does exist
// today: the offsetIndex map, its population in rebuildBootState/flushBatch,
// and its teardown in performCheckpoint.
