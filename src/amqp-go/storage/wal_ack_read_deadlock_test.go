// F1 — the lock cycle between oldFileCacheMutex and bitmapMutex.
//
// THE CYCLE. Three edges:
//
//	QueueWAL.readMessageBatch acquires its file handle from getOldFileHandle.
//	    While that function returned an unlock func() alongside the handle, its
//	    CACHE-HIT path returned qw.oldFileCacheMutex.RUnlock as that unlock — so
//	    oldFileCacheMutex.RLock was held for the whole rest of the function, and
//	    the acknowledgement filter at the end of it takes qw.bitmapMutex.RLock()
//	    inside that scope.
//	        edge: oldFileCacheMutex -> bitmapMutex
//
//	QueueWAL.tryDeleteOldFiles holds bitmapMutex.RLock via defer and calls
//	    closeOldFileHandle, which takes oldFileCacheMutex.Lock() unconditionally —
//	    whether or not that fileNum is actually cached.
//	        edge: bitmapMutex -> oldFileCacheMutex
//
//	WALManager.Acknowledge takes bitmapMutex.Lock() on the CALLER's goroutine, so
//	    a pending writer can coexist with tryDeleteOldFiles' read lock. This is
//	    the leg that closes the cycle.
//
// THE INTERLEAVING:
//
//	G_read   holds oldFileCacheMutex.RLock, has not yet reached the bitmap filter
//	G_clean  holds oldFilesMutex + bitmapMutex.RLock, BLOCKS on oldFileCacheMutex.Lock
//	G_ack    BLOCKS on bitmapMutex.Lock                      (writer now pending)
//	G_read   BLOCKS on bitmapMutex.RLock  -- sync.RWMutex blocks new readers
//	                                         once a writer is waiting
//
//	G_read -> G_ack -> G_clean -> G_read.  Permanent.
//
// HOW THIS FIXTURE DRIVES IT. Nothing is manufactured and no production code is
// touched; every goroutine calls a shipped public method:
//
//	readers  wm.ReadBatch on offsets in a rolled file that is NEVER acked, in a
//	         loop, so after the first (cache-miss) read every subsequent one
//	         takes getOldFileHandle's cache-HIT path. That is the window.
//	ackers   wm.Acknowledge in a loop over a DISJOINT set of offsets, supplying
//	         both the bitmapMutex.Lock writer traffic and, as whole files become
//	         fully acknowledged, the allAcked reclaims that make
//	         tryDeleteOldFiles reach closeOldFileHandle.
//	cleaner  the shipped cleanupLoop, at CleanupInterval=1ms.
//
// The read set and the ack set are disjoint BY FILE and this is load-bearing:
// an acknowledged offset has its offsetIndex entry deleted by cleanupLoop, and
// readMessageBatch errors out without one — so acking a read target would
// silently stop exercising the cache-hit path.
//
// THE DETECTOR IS ZERO PROGRESS, NOT A DEADLINE — and that distinction is the
// whole reason this fixture is allowed to exist under a no-flaky-tests rule.
// A loaded machine still makes progress; a deadlock makes EXACTLY ZERO. That is
// a step function, not a threshold: it cannot be tuned, it cannot drift with the
// hardware, and it cannot be relaxed a second time. The workers keep atomic
// counters; the fixture samples them twice, a grace apart, and declares a wedge
// only when the two samples are IDENTICAL and the workers have not drained.
// For scale, and these are MEASURED on this fixture rather than estimated —
// they are the numbers to judge an observed count against, so a wrong one here
// would mislead exactly the reader who needs them: a healthy 10 s storm runs
// 563774 ReadBatch and 8863334 Acknowledge calls (276088 / 1095616 under
// -race). A wedged tree stops at single- or double-digit ReadBatch and tens to
// low hundreds of Acknowledge calls — 7/36, 12/59 and 29/381 across separate
// runs — because the cycle forms within the first few milliseconds. Five orders
// of magnitude separate the two, so "the counters did not move at all" is not a
// quantity any amount of load can produce.
//
// ON FAILURE THIS FIXTURE FAILS IN-PROCESS WITH ITS OWN GOROUTINE DUMP. It does
// not hang, and it must not be run with a harness -timeout as its detector: the
// dump is captured by runtime.Stack(buf, true) here, logged inline and written to
// a file, which survives any -timeout setting and names the fixture that produced
// it. Read the dump for the three expected frames:
//
//	readMessageBatch  blocked in  sync.(*RWMutex).RLock   (bitmapMutex)
//	Acknowledge       blocked in  sync.(*RWMutex).Lock    (bitmapMutex)
//	tryDeleteOldFiles blocked in  sync.(*RWMutex).Lock    (oldFileCacheMutex,
//	                                                       via closeOldFileHandle)
