// Queue-name -> segment-directory IDENTITY.

// review-4 B-1: the previous scheme reserved "%" as an escape prefix and
// hex-DECODED any directory starting with it. A queue named "%2f" genuinely
// produced <data>/segments/%2f on the old build (it is a perfectly legal single
// path element), so the decode attributed that directory — and every
// checkpointed durable message in it — to a queue named "/". err == nil, no
// fault, no log.
//
// The root problem is that an escape prefix cannot be recognised from the
// STRING ALONE: legacy directories were filepath.Join(dataDir, queueName) for
// any name that was a valid single path element, which includes every possible
// encoded form. These tests pin the property the fix must establish by a
// mechanism OTHER than the string:
//
//	no directory is ever attributed to a queue that did not write it, and
//	no queue's directory is ever missed.
//
// Every fixture below states its premise and asserts it at runtime (canon
// rule 11).

// a single directory entry immediately under <data>/segments, i.e. this is a

// review-4 B-3 — the sealSegment sibling race
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// review-4 B-3 is TWO changes, and they are NOT gated by one fixture. The pair
// is:
//
//	(a) readMessage's active-segment branch holds currentSeg.mutex ACROSS the
//	    ReadAt, not just across the index lookup; and
//	(b) sealSegment performs the index copy, the Close and the handle assign
//	    under ONE hold of currentSegment.mutex, instead of copying the index
//	    under the lock and doing `Close(); file = readFile` outside it.
//
// MUTATION MATRIX (this machine, -race -count=1, each arm a full run):
//
//	arm  mutation                                   result
//	A    clean                                      PASS   reads=295,593 closed=0
//	B    (b) reverted alone                         PASS   reads=296,303 closed=0
//	E    (a) reverted alone, (b) clean              FAIL   reads=289,456 closed=25 + DATA RACE
//
// Arm B is why this fixture is named for (a) and not for the seal. Detection
// here is carried ENTIRELY by the reader-side lock. The reason (b) is invisible
// through the public Read path is structural, not luck: writeMessage holds
// qs.mutex across sealSegment()+openNextSegmentLocked() and readMessage takes
// qs.mutex to snapshot currentSeg, so a reader either snapshots BEFORE the
// writer acquires qs.mutex — and then has only a map lookup and a ReadAt left
// to run while the sealer still has a full F_FULLFSYNC ahead of it — or it
// snapshots AFTER and gets the fresh segment. A reader arriving through
// sm.Read is therefore always microseconds ahead of a Close that is
// milliseconds away. Widening the window INSIDE the sealer cannot change that;
// the reviewer confirmed this by inserting a 2 ms sleep between the Close and
// the assign, which also passed.
//
// (b) IS observable, but only to a holder of the *SegmentFile itself — which is
// exactly what readMessage becomes the instant it releases qs.mutex.
// TestSegmentSeal_HandleSwapIsAtomicUnderTheSegmentLock below gates that half
// directly and goes RED on arm B.
//
// The defect both halves prevent: the reader gets `file already closed`, and
// per architecture.md §4 deliverMessage turns a post-claim GetMessage error
// into a GAP SKIP, so the message is dropped rather than retried.
//
// PREMISE — CONCURRENCY: review-4 needed 32 readers; FOUR separate 8-reader
// configurations found nothing. The reader count is therefore a load-bearing
// premise of this fixture and is asserted, not commented.
// segSealRaceSegmentSize holds roughly four segTestMessages records, so a seal
// lands every fourth write and the active segment is normally non-empty.
const segSealRaceSegmentSize = 240

// segSealRaceDuration is the MINIMUM time the fixture runs. It is a REGIME
// parameter, not a timeout: sealSegment fsyncs, and macOS F_FULLFSYNC caps this
// machine at roughly 190 seals/second, so the seal count is a function of wall
// time.
