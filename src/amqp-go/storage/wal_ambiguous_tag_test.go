// Two follow-up determinations for Loop 3 Step 1, both requested by the
// observer and both kept SEPARATE from R1's and R3's verdicts.
//
// D1 — DOES THE TAG COLLISION ALONE HARM ANYTHING TODAY?
//
// R1 proved that after a restart and redeclare of a non-durable queue the
// broker re-mints delivery tags already carried by physically-present records
// of the previous incarnation. The shared WAL is GLOBALLY TAG-KEYED with no
// queue discriminator (Step 0, DO NOT RE-DERIVE #5), so two records sharing one
// key is not obviously benign, and the question is separate from any ack set:
// what do the offset index, the read path, and recovery each do when the key is
// ambiguous?
//
// D2 — IS performCheckpoint's CROSS-FILE INDEX EVICTION REACHABLE, AND WHAT
//      DOES IT COST?
//
// performCheckpoint's offsetIndex cleanup deletes BY OFFSET VALUE ONLY:
//
//	it := info.offsets.Iterator()
//	for it.HasNext() { delete(qw.offsetIndex, it.Next()) }
//
// with no check that offsetIndex[offset].fileNum == the file being reclaimed.
// So checkpointing file X can evict an index entry that belongs to file Y. That
// is the same shape as the binding-filename defect Loop 2 closed: cleanup keyed
// on something insufficiently discriminating, evicting a live record of a
// different identity. It is independent of candidate C and must not leave with
// it if C is abandoned.
//
// The read path is what decides the COST, and it is why this is not obviously
// only a performance question — readMessageSequential iterates oldFiles in GO
// MAP ORDER and returns the first file whose bitmap contains the offset:
//
//	for _, fileInfo := range qw.oldFiles {
//	    if fileInfo.offsets != nil && fileInfo.offsets.Contains(offset) {
//	        return qw.readMessageFromFile(queueName, fileInfo.path, offset)
//	    }
//	}
//
// If two files both contain the tag and the index entry is gone, that loop can
// return EITHER record. Returning the older one is not a slow read, it is the
// WRONG PAYLOAD.

// WHY A READ OF AN ACKED TAG IS AN ORDINARY OPERATION, not a contrived one:

// nothing back. If a stale record answers instead, the reaper treats a previous
// incarnation's message as live: it evaluates that message's TTL, may
// dead-letter it (deadLetter(..., DeadLetterExpired)), and — in the tail-advance
