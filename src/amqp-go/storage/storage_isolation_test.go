// own directory as cwd, so this name denotes src/amqp-go/storage/data here and
// src/amqp-go/data in the root package — which is why two contaminated
// directories existed, one per leak route.
//
// This is a deliberate second copy of the same guard. Go gives test helpers no
// way to be shared across packages without exporting them from a non-test
// package, and the whole point is that the check runs with each package's own
// cwd. If you change this, change testserver_test.go in the root package too.

// in pending_ack_index_test.go shared one directory with each other AND across
// runs. They now take b.TempDir()/t.TempDir(). This assertion is what stops
// the next caller of NewDisruptorStorage() from silently reinstating it — the
// directory is gitignored, so nothing else in the toolchain would report it.
