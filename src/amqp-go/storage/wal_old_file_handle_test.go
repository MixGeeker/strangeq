// Commit 1's fixtures — the old-file handle cache stops handing its lock to its
// callers, and the platform guarantee that makes that safe is asserted rather
// than documented.
//
// EVERY FIXTURE IN THIS FILE NEEDS A ROLLED WAL FILE. getOldFileHandle is
// reached only from the `else` arm of `location.fileNum == currentFileNum`; the
// current file is served from currentReadFile and takes no cache lock at all. At
// DefaultWALFileSize (512 MB) nothing here rolls and every one of these fixtures
// would pass while executing none of the code it names, which is the exact
// vacuous-premise shape that let a data-loss defect certify green three times.
// newRolledWAL overrides FileSize and ASSERTS the roll.
