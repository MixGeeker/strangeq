// Commit 2's fixtures — the TWO acknowledgement guards in
// DisruptorStorage.GetMessage, each attributed to its OWN observable.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. segment_ack_gate_test.go covers the pair jointly and
// cannot tell them apart: deleting either guard alone leaves it green, and only
// deleting both reddens it (at segment_ack_gate_test.go:212). That is the
// signature of one observable written twice — "the same mutation as the line
// above", tests.md §2 — and it left both guards unattributed.
//
// They are NOT one observable. They guard different windows and the difference
// is directly observable; the segment fixture is blind to it only because it
// acknowledges BEFORE it probes, which is the one ordering in which the two
// guards agree.
//
//	pre-read gate   a short-circuit. Its observable is that NO COLD TIER IS
//	                CONSULTED. It is not load-bearing for correctness on any tree
//	                — the re-validate catches everything it catches — but it is
//	                what keeps queue_reaper.go reapTTLSweep, which acknowledges a
//	                tag and re-probes it every sweep, from walking readAhead ->
//	                wal.ReadBatch -> wal.Read -> segments.Read (up to three disk
//	                reads) only to return the same error.
//
//	re-validate     the CORRECTNESS guard. Its observable is an acknowledgement
//	                that lands WHILE a cold read is in flight. The pre-read gate
//	                has already run and correctly seen nothing, so it is the only
//	                guard that can refuse.
//
// THE RIG, and why it is deterministic rather than raced. Both fixtures hold the
// SEGMENT TIER HOSTAGE: QueueSegments.readMessage takes qs.mutex as its very
// first act (segment_manager.go), and DisruptorStorage.DeleteMessage never takes
// that lock — SegmentManager.Acknowledge is a non-blocking ackChan send — so a
// test holding qs.mutex can park a reader inside the segment tier and
// acknowledge into that window with no race and no deadlock.
//
// ONE CONSTRAINT ON THE RIG, stated because it is invisible and a future edit
// would walk straight into it: SegmentManager.Acknowledge's non-blocking send
// has a fallback. If ackChan is FULL it calls applyAck INLINE, which reaches
// acknowledgeInSegment and takes qs.mutex — the lock these fixtures are holding.
// That would deadlock the test against itself. It cannot happen here because
// each fixture issues exactly ONE acknowledgement against a freshly built
// storage with an empty channel. Anyone adding acknowledgements to these
// fixtures must keep that true, or acknowledge before taking qs.mutex.
//
// The segment tier is not an arbitrary choice: it is the ONLY UNGATED COLD TIER
// (that is F2), so it is the only arm that can hand an acknowledged record back
// to GetMessage and thereby reach the re-validate at all. The WAL arms cannot —
// readMessageBatch filters and QueueWAL.readMessage has its own gate — which is
// exactly why a fixture parked on QueueWAL.fileMutex proves nothing about
// either guard.
//
// NO ASSERTION IN THIS FILE IS A THRESHOLD. Every verdict comes from a POSITIVE
// observation: either the reader was seen parked inside QueueSegments.readMessage
// (via a runtime.Stack dump the fixture captures itself), or it was seen to
// return. The one duration here is a backstop for the case where NEITHER is
// observed, and it yields SKIP — never a pass and never a failure — because a
// run that could not establish its own precondition proves nothing (tests.md §3).
