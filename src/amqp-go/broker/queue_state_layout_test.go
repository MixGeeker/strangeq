// TestQueueStateLayoutUnchanged pins the offsets of QueueState's dispatch-plane
// hot fields, following the precedent in protocol/consumer_layout_test.go and
// storage/segment_layout_test.go: when a hot struct is edited, pin its layout
// so a later insertion cannot silently move a hot field without a test going
// red.
//
// This is the falsifiable form of spec-b4's zero-regression claim: TagBand
// (broker/queue_dispatch.go) is a METHOD, not a field — it reads ordinalBase
// (already present) and derives its upper bound from the existing SeqMask
// constant. The purge-incarnation fix therefore adds NO field to QueueState.
// Values measured on this machine (darwin/arm64) and re-confirmed byte-for-byte
// against clean 7a09e63 with the same toolchain, so they pin the struct rather
// than the compiler. Deliberately no Go version is quoted: the pin was checked
// on go1.25.1 and go1.26.0 with identical results, and a stale version here
// sends the next reader chasing a toolchain difference that does not exist.
