// RegisterConsumer used to persist LAST, after it had already stored a
// ConsumerState in activeConsumers, registered a storage ack cursor, appended to
// queueConsumers and spawned a poll-loop goroutine. Returning the store error
// from there left all four behind with no handle any caller could use to undo
// them — a leaked goroutine and a leaked ConsumerState per failure. It was
// invisible only because StoreConsumer is a no-op in every implementation, i.e.
// a correctness bug held harmless by dead code. The fix persists write-ahead, so
// there is no window in which partial state exists.
//
// The residue assertions are deliberately about broker-visible state rather than
// about goroutine counts: activeConsumers is the only handle the poll-loop
// goroutine is reachable through, so proving that map is clean proves the
// goroutine was never started.
