	// NO BINDING FIELD. It existed, was initialised to an empty slice by

	//
	// Durable bindings DO survive a restart, and not through recovery: the
	// routing path re-reads them from storage on every publish
	// (broker/storage_broker.go calls GetExchangeBindings /
	// GetExchangeBindingsFrom from its routing functions, ~14 sites), backed by
	// PersistentMetadataStore.ListBindings and its caches. The CBOR files are
	// the authority; the in-memory exchange is not. Re-establishing bindings at
	// boot would therefore create a SECOND source of truth for a fact that is
	// already correct, so this was deleted rather than wired (canon rule 6).
