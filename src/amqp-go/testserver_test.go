// accept loop, so a port collision is reported here as the real errno rather
// than as a poll-budget timeout sixty seconds later. The budget is

// returned error — so they cannot use a helper that calls FailNow. They still
// capture Start()'s error rather than discarding it.
//
// This sentence used to claim "every embedded-broker helper in this package",
// which was false three ways, and restartableBroker.start() sat outside it
// discarding Start()'s error for exactly as long as the claim went unchecked.

// counting like any other — the step that wrote this one repeated its framing
// instead of counting the helpers, and inherited the same error.
