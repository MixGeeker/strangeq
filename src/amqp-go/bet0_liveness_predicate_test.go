// The multi-queue liveness predicate — THIS IS THE P0 GATE.
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// TestBet0_ConcurrentMultiQueueDelivery and TestBet0_MultiQueueWithConfirmsDelivers
// both assert through bet0CheckLiveness. It is the assertion that proves
// multi-queue delivery starvation is dead.
//
// ⛔ READ THIS BEFORE RETUNING ANY CONSTANT BELOW. ⛔
//
// The natural way to stop this test flaking is to loosen a threshold until it
// goes quiet. That retires the detector while leaving the suite green, which is
// strictly worse than a red test. Every constant here has a MEASURED band on
// both sides and the measurements are recorded in the comment on each. If this
// flakes, the answer is to find out why the broker's numbers moved, not to move
// the number.
//
// WHY THERE ARE THREE TERMS AND NOT ONE.
//
// Under the race detector, consumed/published stops being a liveness measure.
// Publishers run unthrottled in a tight loop, so the ratio measures the
// publish:consume SPEED DIFFERENTIAL, and instrumentation moves that
// differential without any queue being starved. The measured bands overlap:
//
//	HEALTHY tree, CI run 116 under -race:   0.1397 .. 0.4359
//	BROKEN  tree (8a65f98) under -race:     0.0921 .. 0.1520  (surviving queue)
//
// A broken tree's surviving queue scores 0.1089 while a healthy CI run scores
// 0.1397. The bands interleave, and the broken value is the HIGHER-scoring
// queue of a tree whose neighbour is at absolute zero. So under -race no rate
// floor can separate "degraded but alive" from "healthy": a floor can detect
// DEATH, never HEALTH. Hence:
//
//	minRatio   (L) — LIVENESS. "this queue is not dead." Never "fast enough".
//	minBalance (B) — the DIAGNOSTIC. One queue materially below its neighbour.
//	minRateRatio   — the real "keeping up" floor. Only an uninstrumented run
//	                 can support it, so it is disabled under -race.
//
// L and B cover precisely each other's blind spots. L cannot catch gate §11's
// partial case (one queue at 0.35 beside a healthy neighbour sails over any
// usable floor); B catches it at 0.35/0.90 = 0.389. B cannot catch a UNIFORM
// collapse (both queues equally dead ⇒ balance ≈ 1.0 — the dossier's perftest
// shape, 558 consumed of 1.67M across two queues); L catches it at ~0.0003.
// Neither term is redundant. Removing either one opens a hole with a name.
//
// BALANCE IS COMPUTED ON CONSUMED COUNTS, NOT ON consumed/published RATIOS.
//
// This matters, and it is the one place where getting the metric wrong costs
// almost all the margin. Dividing by `published` imports publisher-side noise
// into what is supposed to be a delivery-liveness assertion. Measured on the
// fixed tree, -race, GOMAXPROCS=4, `mixed` shape: q1's producers published
// 237,201 while q2's published 117,345 — a 2x spread, because a durable queue
// and a transient queue apply different backpressure to their PRODUCERS. Over
// the same window the two queues consumed 42,353 and 40,100: the dispatch
// planes did nearly identical work. Ratio-balance calls that 0.5225; consumed
// balance calls it 0.9468. The first number is an artifact of the divisor.
//
// Across n=32 healthy observations on both trees:
//
//	metric            worst healthy   starved   margin at the 0.50 floor
//	ratio-balance          0.5152      0.0000       1.03x  — a coin flip
//	consumed-balance       0.8577      0.0000       1.72x
//
// Consumed counts measure the invariant the test actually states: a queue's
// delivery liveness must not depend on whether OTHER, unrelated queues are
// being published to. Gate §11's partial case (0.35 beside 0.90 on equal
// published) trips at 0.389 under either metric, so nothing is given up.
//
// ⚠️ LOAD-BEARING PREMISE, stated because leaving it implicit was Loop 1's most
// common error class. Consumed-balance is valid only while ALL THREE hold:
//
//  1. Every queue has an identical consumer count and identical prefetch, so
//     comparable consumption is the expected healthy state.
//  2. Every queue is deeply backlogged, PER QUEUE (consumed << published), so
//     consumption measures dispatch capacity rather than offered load. One
//     queue going publish-limited is enough to break the term even if the run
//     looks backlogged in aggregate: a queue that published 12,001 and consumed
//     all of them beside a neighbour that consumed 30,000 reads as balance 0.40
//     on a perfectly healthy broker.
//  3. Every queue carries comparable PER-MESSAGE delivery cost — uniform body
//     size across queues. Consumed counts compare messages, not bytes; a
//     variant with 128 B on one queue and 64 KB on its neighbour would compare
//     unlike quantities and could read a healthy broker as imbalanced by the
//     size ratio. All current shapes satisfy this by construction (128 B on
//     both queues in the repro, 1 KB on both in the confirms test).
//
// Heterogeneous delivery PATHS are fine and are not a fourth condition: the
// `mixed` shape already has one — the durable queue's deliveries go through the
// WAL, the transient queue's do not — and consumed still tracks within 5%
// (42,353 vs 40,100). It is size, not path, that would break this.
//
// A variant breaking any of the three must RE-DERIVE this term, not re-tune its
// constant. Condition 2 is not merely documented — bet0PremiseNotice checks it
// at runtime, per queue, and says so out loud when it starts to erode. That is
// the difference between a premise and a comment: this one is falsifiable, and
// it has already been falsified once (it does not hold on the uninstrumented
// path, which is why balance is disabled there).
//
// The evidence behind the numbers, and the table test at the bottom of this
// file that keeps the predicate honest against every recorded dataset, is the
// standing double-guard: a mutation proof on the real broker PLUS a check that
// the predicate is actually discriminating, so a silently dead fixture cannot
// report success.
//
// ⛔ IF YOU ARE HERE BECAUSE "THE OLD TEST FAILED 3 SUBTESTS ON THE BROKEN TREE
// AND THIS ONE ONLY FAILS 2" — READ THIS BEFORE RESTORING ANYTHING.
//
// That comparison is real and its obvious conclusion is wrong. On the pre-fix
// tree (8a65f98) under -race, the old 0.50 rate floor reddened all three
// subtests. This predicate reds `durable` and `mixed` and leaves `transient`
// green. The difference is not lost coverage: **the old red on `transient` was a
// FALSE POSITIVE**, and one third of the evidence that the old predicate
// detected the P0 was never evidence at all.
//
// Measured on the broken tree, 4 independent runs: transient q1/q2 ratios
// 0.3847/0.3526, 0.3946/0.3693, 0.3632/0.3344, 0.3762/0.3361 — both queues
// alive, both delivering at ~35-39% of an unthrottled instrumented publisher,
// balanced to within 11%. There is no starvation on that shape on that tree. It
// failed the old floor purely because -race depresses the ratio, at 0.3847
// against 0.50.
//
// And that is expected, not lucky. This file's own header says all-transient
// "is carried as a guard that must stay healthy": on an empty WAL the cold-read
// miss returns fast enough that hole-crawl outruns tag-mint, so the P0 does not
// manifest there at all. A predicate that reds on `transient` is red for the
// wrong reason.
//
// The general lesson, which cost this loop real time to learn: **a test going
// red on a broken tree is not proof that it detects the break.** Check WHICH
// assertion fired and whether the mechanism is even present, before counting it
// as coverage.
//
// ⛔ WHAT THIS PREDICATE DOES NOT CATCH — READ BEFORE TRUSTING A GREEN CI RUN.
//
// Under -race, a regression that slows EVERY queue equally is invisible to this
// predicate. Broken-tree per-queue ratios (0.0921-0.1520) interleave with
// healthy CI ratios (0.1397), so no floor can separate them; balance reads ~1.0
// because the degradation is uniform. Only the uninstrumented 0.50 rate floor
// catches this class, and CI never runs uninstrumented. **CI green is therefore
// not evidence that uniform delivery degradation is absent.**
//
// Note this is a different hole from uniform COLLAPSE (both queues near zero),
// which the liveness term does catch at ~0.0003. The gap is uniform
// DEGRADATION — both queues alive but equally slowed.
//
// WHAT KIND OF EVIDENCE BACKS EACH TERM, stated because they are not equal:
// LIVENESS is proven against the real defect — it is the term that fires on the
// pre-fix tree, 6/6 reds in the pristine proof. BALANCE never fires there,
// because liveness is checked first and the starved queue sits at exactly zero.
// Balance is independently sufficient on that data (0/12538 = 0.000), but the
// pristine proof does not EXERCISE it. Its only active guard is the synthesized
// `partial starvation — 0.35 beside 0.90` row in the table test below, which is
// the one case where liveness passes and only balance can fire. So: liveness is
// proven against a measured defect, balance against a constructed one. Both
// earn their place — the L→0.0 mutation shows liveness alone misses uniform
// collapse — but do not read the pristine RED as evidence that balance works.
