// redelivery after a crash is explicitly modelled — the redelivered flag
// exists for it. What at-least-once covers is the window between a delivery
// and the durable recording of its acknowledgement. This broker has no such
// window: the WAL ackBitmap and the segment ackBitmap are never persisted and
// never rebuilt, so acknowledgement is never made durable at all, and
// "at least once" degenerates into "again in full after every restart,
// forever". A durable queue is required to survive a restart (queue.declare
// durable=true); a queue that comes back holding messages that had been
// removed from it before the restart has not survived, it has been reverted,
// and basic.get answers get-ok where the same call answered get-empty one
// restart earlier. That is protocol-observable state moving backwards, which
// no consumer can dedupe against because nothing about the replay is bounded.
//
// The assertion is written at the AMQP level (the queue is empty) rather than
// at the storage level (RecoverFromWAL returns nothing) deliberately: it is
// the contract, and it leaves the implementer free to satisfy it by persisting
// ack state, by applying already-persisted consumer offset checkpoints at
// boot, or by compaction.
//
// NOTE for the implementer: storage/wal_recovery_test.go's
// TestWALRecovery_BasicRecovery currently asserts the OPPOSITE at the storage
// layer ("Should recover all messages (ACKs not persisted)"). The two are
// compatible only if the fix records ack durability above RecoverFromWAL. If
// it does not, that existing test must be re-argued in the loop log against
// this ruling — not quietly deleted, and not used to weaken this one.

//
// Defect: acknowledgement is never made durable. The WAL's ackBitmap and the
